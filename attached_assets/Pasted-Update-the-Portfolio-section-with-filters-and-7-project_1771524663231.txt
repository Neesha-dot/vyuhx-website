FILTER BUTTONS JSX:
```jsx
const [filter, setFilter] = useState('All');

const filteredProjects = filter === 'All' 
  ? projects 
  : projects.filter(p => p.category === filter);

// Filter Buttons
<div className="filter-buttons">
  <button
    className={`filter-btn ${filter === 'All' ? 'active' : ''}`}
    onClick={() => setFilter('All')}
  >
    All
  </button>
  <button
    className={`filter-btn ${filter === 'Web' ? 'active' : ''}`}
    onClick={() => setFilter('Web')}
  >
    Web
  </button>
  <button
    className={`filter-btn ${filter === 'Software' ? 'active' : ''}`}
    onClick={() => setFilter('Software')}
  >
    Software
  </button>
  <button
    className={`filter-btn ${filter === 'Dashboard' ? 'active' : ''}`}
    onClick={() => setFilter('Dashboard')}
  >
    Dashboard
  </button>
</div>
```

FILTER BEHAVIOR:

When "All" is clicked:
✅ Show all 7 projects (6 Web + 1 Software)

When "Web" is clicked:
✅ Show only 6 Web projects:
- Cafe Twenty Twenty
- Cafe Queue Management
- Shreerath Feedback System
- Bomb Rolls Feedback System
- Bomb Rolls and Bowls
- SJ Interior

When "Software" is clicked:
✅ Show only 1 Software project:
- FRA Tool Analyser

When "Dashboard" is clicked:
❌ Show 0 projects (empty state)
OR
✅ Remove "Dashboard" filter button entirely (cleaner option)

OPTION 1 - KEEP DASHBOARD FILTER (show empty state):
```jsx
{filteredProjects.length === 0 && (
  <div className="empty-state">
    <p>No projects in this category yet.</p>
  </div>
)}
```

OPTION 2 - REMOVE DASHBOARD FILTER (recommended):
```jsx
<div className="filter-buttons">
  {['All', 'Web', 'Software'].map(f => (
    <button
      key={f}
      className={`filter-btn ${filter === f ? 'active' : ''}`}
      onClick={() => setFilter(f)}
    >
      {f}
    </button>
  ))}
</div>
```

GRID LAYOUT:
- First row: 3 projects
- Second row: 3 projects
- Third row: 1 project (FRA Tool when "All" is selected)

When "Web" filter:
- First row: 3 projects
- Second row: 3 projects
- Total: 6 projects

When "Software" filter:
- Only 1 project shown (FRA Tool)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
✅ Total projects: 7 (was 8)
✅ Removed: FinDash Pro
✅ Web category: 6 projects
✅ Software category: 1 project (FRA Tool)
✅ Dashboard category: 0 projects
✅ Moved Shreerath & Bomb Rolls Feedback from Dashboard → Web
✅ Filter buttons: All, Web, Software, Dashboard (or remove Dashboard)
✅ Filtering works correctly

KEEP UNCHANGED:
- Card design and layout (3 per row)
- Card hover animations
- Tech tag styling
- "Case Study" link behavior
- Section heading and subtitle
- All other sections of website
- Image quality and aspect ratios

RECOMMENDATION:
Remove "Dashboard" filter button entirely since no projects use it.
This keeps the UI cleaner with just: [All] [Web] [Software]
