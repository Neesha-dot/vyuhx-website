"The ScrollToTop button was created but is NOT visible on the page. Debug and fix it. Search through ALL files:
STEP 1 — VERIFY the component file exists and check for errors:

Find the ScrollToTop.tsx or ScrollToTop.jsx file
Open browser console (F12) and check if there are any React errors or TypeScript errors
If there are errors, fix them

STEP 2 — FORCE the button to be ALWAYS VISIBLE for testing:

In the ScrollToTop component, temporarily REMOVE or COMMENT OUT the line if (!isVisible) return null;
This will make the button always visible regardless of scroll position — just for debugging

STEP 3 — ADD extreme styling to make button super obvious:
Replace the button styles with these EXTREME values to make it impossible to miss:
jsxstyle={{
  position: 'fixed',
  bottom: '20px',
  right: '20px',
  width: '80px',
  height: '80px',
  background: 'red',  // Temporary bright red for testing
  border: '5px solid yellow',  // Yellow border for visibility
  borderRadius: '50%',
  cursor: 'pointer',
  display: 'flex',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  zIndex: 999999,  // Extremely high z-index
  fontSize: '40px',
  color: 'white',
}}
And replace the SVG with simple text temporarily:
jsx<span>↑</span>
STEP 4 — VERIFY App.tsx import:

Open App.tsx
Make sure this line exists: import ScrollToTop from './components/ScrollToTop';
Make sure this line exists in the JSX: <ScrollToTop />
Check that <ScrollToTop /> is OUTSIDE all other components, at the very end before closing </div>

STEP 5 — Check for CSS conflicts:

Search the project for any global CSS that might have position: fixed elements hidden or overlapping
Check if there's a global overflow: hidden on body or root div

AFTER FIXING — tell me:

Is the button now visible?
What errors were in the console?
Which files did you edit?
Once it's visible, we'll revert to the nice cyan styling

STRICT RULES:

Fix whatever is preventing the button from showing
Do not touch any other sections
Report back all errors found"**
